# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the FlatList component in React Native with large datasets. The problem is characterized by the FlatList failing to render correctly, often resulting in a blank screen or incomplete rendering of the data.

## Problem

The primary challenge lies in the lack of detailed error messages.  Debugging this issue often requires careful examination of the code's interaction with the FlatList component and potentially investigating performance bottlenecks. The provided example illustrates this scenario.

## Solution

The solution involves optimizing the rendering process of the FlatList by using techniques like `keyExtractor`, `getItemLayout`, and potentially implementing windowing or virtualization strategies for improved performance.

The `FlatListBugSolution.js` file presents a solution that enhances performance.
